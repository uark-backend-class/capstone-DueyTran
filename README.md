Shogun Inventory API

The problems I'm trying to solve...

1. Make tracking and ordering inventory easier.

Prior to this API, we would have to mark down inventory on pen and paper every week.
Give the order to our manager, then he would have to call in the order by phone. 
We didn't have an accurate way to track the exact quantity of each item.
If it looked low, then we would order more.

With this API, we could track each item accurately with a weekly update.
Orders would be filled out via form data and sent out by email to our purveyors, skipping the middleman.

2. Leave some of my knowledge behind for the trainees.

I plan on leaving Shogun as the head sushi chef. One of my responsibilities was to train new chefs.
I want to pass along some of my knowledge to the trainees so they could have some fundamentals to build upon. 
The best way I could think of was to leave instructional videos teaching how to prepare certain items. 
During a rush, one of the things you don't want to do is take too long thinking of how to plate an order.
I added a picture reference page to act as a plating template of sorts. 
I think having those images as a base will help a lot more than having nothing.
